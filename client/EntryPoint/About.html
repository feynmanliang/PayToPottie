          Never have to hold it in again.
          Finding a place to do your deed isn't just
          a hassle, it's a painful struggle between
          embarassment and more embarassment. Avoid the
          Catch 22's and always have a bathroom.

          Save money and consume less. Stop buying small things just to become a
          "paying customer" when we both know what you really want.
